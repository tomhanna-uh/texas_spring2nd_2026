## What is politics? 

- **Not distant** 
- **immediate,right here**
- **touches everything**
- **direct impacts are constant**
- **involves all of us**
- **It can be expensive, but it's not always about money**



## Politics is powerful

- Immense power to achieve good ends 
- Immense power to do incredible harm

## Why is poltiics so potentially harmful?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 3em;"}
Why does politics have such power to cause harm?
:::



## Introduction to Government

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
To really understand government and politics we first need to know what those things are. 
:::


## What is government?

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
What is government?
:::

- Government is what it does
- Government is something else more fundamental



## What does government do?

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
Collective action: organizing individuals to achieve a common goal
:::




## Is government the only group that engages in collective action?


:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
Is government the only group that engages in collective action?
:::


## Other organizations that engage in collective action

- Family
- Churches
- Charities
- Businesses!
- Community organizations




## What makes government different?


::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
What makes government different from other organizations?
:::


## Enforcement of rules

![Severe Penalties](severe_penalties.jpg){width="90%"}



## How does government enforce rules?

- police force
- prison system
- military
- **enforcement backed by violent, armed force**



## Formal definition of government

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 75px;"}
Government is the organization that has the **exclusive right to use organized coercive force** in a given territory that is commonly perceived as **legitimate**.
:::

## Breaking down the definition

- organized
- coercive
- violent
- legitimate


## What is politics?

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 75px;"}
Politics is the process of making collective decisions in the context of government. Making collective decisions about why, how, and when to use coercive force.
:::





## Why limit government?

- Because at its core government is violent force
- Violent force is easily abused
- Even good uses of government still rely on violent force
- Government is necessary, but it is also dangerous

    


    
        

## How do we limit government in the US system?

- The US and Texas Constitutions
- Define its powers in the Constitutions
- Set limits to its powers in the Constitutions
- Guarantee rights to individuals in the Constitutions
...

- But can we make those paper guarantees stand up to the reality of violent force?


## The first limit on power

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
By dividing the power among competing groups with different agendas
:::


## Federal level

![Separation of Powers](separation_of_powers.jpg){width="90%"}

## The second limit on power

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
Giving each of those groups powers to limit each of the others
:::




## Checks and Balances

![Checks and Balances](checks_arrows.jpg){width="90%"}


## State level

We do the same thing at the state level, but with different names

- President - Executive (more than the Governor)
- Congress - Legislature 
- Courts - Courts



## One more limit

What is perhaps the biggest separation of powers in the US system?

- Federal vs 50 states
- Under the US Constitution, the federal government is limited to only those powers that are explicitly granted to it. 
- All other powers are reserved to the states or the people.


## Supremacy

- The US Constitution is the supreme law of the land
- The federal government is supreme in areas given to it by the US Constitution
- Under the state constitutions, the states are supreme in anything not prohibited *by US Constitution* (10th Amendment)
- Note: this does not say, "prohibited by Congress" or "prohibited by the President" or even "prohibited by the Supreme Court





## State vs Federal Powers

![State vs Federal Powers](powers.jpg){width="90%"}


## The Final Check

What is the final peaceful check on federal tyranny?

- One of the least talked about and most important state powers for preventing federal tyranny is the power to...

- **Conduct elections**
